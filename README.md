> Our Little Planet

---

I've been learning all these little weird things and I just realized they're all sort of the same thing but from different angles. 

This is the (horrible) source code for a thing that's had a bunch of different forms. It's sort of an instrument? But it's called Our Little Planet? And even that might be a node on this weirder larger thing I'm trying to make? Dunno. My ideas outreach my talents by about a thousand miles.

If for some reason you find this interesting you can email me at alexcarusillo@gmail.com and I'd love to help our take feedback. This is all hosted at under-construction.club

This codebase is a work in progress and I'm not a good engineer so don't try to make any sense of it


// Eventually this either
a) gives people a very limited set of tools (subset of synth inputs better visualized) to create their own instruments and play them live for "relaxation"
b) lets me create those instruments and share them like ambient music boxes people can passively listen to

also none of the code for mutating the loops is in here yet because its a really obnoxious but this will obviously have a whole config menu for that
